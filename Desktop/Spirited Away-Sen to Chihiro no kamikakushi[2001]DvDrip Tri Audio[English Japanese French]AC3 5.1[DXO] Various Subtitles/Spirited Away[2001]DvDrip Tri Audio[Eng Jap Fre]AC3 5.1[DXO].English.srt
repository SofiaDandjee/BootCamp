1
00:00:00,467 --> 00:00:06,099
A Studio Ghibli Film

2
00:00:06,439 --> 00:00:10,034
<i>2001 Nibariki-TGNDDTM</i>

3
00:00:12,645 --> 00:00:15,273
<i>Good Luck, Chihiro
We'll meet again</i>

4
00:00:15,448 --> 00:00:16,813
Chihiro

5
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:18,279
Chihiro,

6
00:00:18,451 --> 00:00:19,975
we're almost there

7
00:00:22,822 --> 00:00:24,790
This really is the
middle of nowhere

8
00:00:24,958 --> 00:00:27,756
I'll have to shop
in the next town

9
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:30,295
It'll be great, once
we get used to it

10
00:00:32,332 --> 00:00:34,357
Look, there's the school

11
00:00:34,467 --> 00:00:36,128
That's your new school, Chihiro

12
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:39,331
It doesn't look so bad

13
00:00:47,147 --> 00:00:49,172
I liked my old school...

14
00:00:53,486 --> 00:00:56,148
Mommy...
My flowers died

15
00:00:56,523 --> 00:00:58,991
No wonder, the way
you clung to them

16
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:02,026
A little water when we get there
and they'll perk right up

17
00:01:03,163 --> 00:01:06,724
My very first bouquet is
farewell flowers, how sad

18
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:10,166
What about that rose
you got for your birthday?

19
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:13,464
One rose isn't a bouquet

20
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:15,200
You dropped your card

21
00:01:15,341 --> 00:01:16,774
I'm opening the window

22
00:01:16,876 --> 00:01:19,936
C'mon now, behave yourself
It's a big day for all of us

23
00:01:38,965 --> 00:01:44,369
SPIRITED AWAY

24
00:01:56,622 --> 00:02:00,490
Hey...
Did I take the wrong turn?

25
00:02:00,993 --> 00:02:02,460
I don't get it

26
00:02:02,628 --> 00:02:04,653
That must be it, look

27
00:02:05,331 --> 00:02:07,458
It must be that
blue one over there

28
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,297
That's it

29
00:02:09,969 --> 00:02:12,403
I must've missed the turn-off

30
00:02:12,672 --> 00:02:14,606
I bet this road'll get us there

31
00:02:14,707 --> 00:02:17,232
This is always how
you get us lost

32
00:02:17,343 --> 00:02:19,311
Just a little farther, OK?

33
00:02:19,812 --> 00:02:21,541
What are those little houses?

34
00:02:21,647 --> 00:02:23,308
They're shrines
People pray to them

35
00:02:30,323 --> 00:02:31,881
Daddy, are we lost?

36
00:02:31,991 --> 00:02:34,551
We're fine, we've
got 4-wheel drive

37
00:02:35,161 --> 00:02:36,423
Sit down, Chihiro

38
00:02:56,716 --> 00:02:58,877
You're going to kill us!

39
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,919
A tunnel?

40
00:03:16,402 --> 00:03:18,029
What's this strange building?

41
00:03:18,204 --> 00:03:20,297
Must be the entrance

42
00:03:20,907 --> 00:03:21,532
Honey...

43
00:03:21,908 --> 00:03:24,240
Let's go back, honey

44
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:26,100
Chihiro

45
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:28,376
No...

46
00:03:28,915 --> 00:03:31,349
It's just plaster

47
00:03:31,451 --> 00:03:33,646
This building's pretty new

48
00:03:43,596 --> 00:03:44,893
The wind's going in

49
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:46,565
What is it?

50
00:03:46,732 --> 00:03:48,893
Let's have a look
There's a way through

51
00:03:49,602 --> 00:03:51,593
It's creepy, Daddy, let's go back

52
00:03:52,238 --> 00:03:54,502
No need to be scared

53
00:03:54,607 --> 00:03:56,370
Just a little farther, OK?

54
00:03:56,476 --> 00:03:58,410
The moving van'll
get there before us

55
00:03:58,611 --> 00:04:02,707
So, let 'em, they've got the keys
Let the movers move us

56
00:04:02,815 --> 00:04:03,839
I know, but...

57
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:05,781
No! I won't go!

58
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,081
Daddy, let's go back

59
00:04:10,189 --> 00:04:11,417
Nothing to be scared of

60
00:04:11,757 --> 00:04:13,520
I won't go!

61
00:04:21,634 --> 00:04:24,262
Chihiro, you wait in the car

62
00:04:26,105 --> 00:04:28,039
Mommy

63
00:04:29,942 --> 00:04:31,136
Wait

64
00:04:36,816 --> 00:04:38,443
Watch your step

65
00:04:38,618 --> 00:04:41,815
You'll make me trip, Chihiro,
clinging like that

66
00:05:13,819 --> 00:05:14,945
Where are we?

67
00:05:15,054 --> 00:05:17,215
Say, do you hear that?

68
00:05:26,032 --> 00:05:26,999
It's a train!

69
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:28,963
Maybe we're near the station

70
00:05:29,068 --> 00:05:30,899
Let's go and find out

71
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:09,867
What are those houses doing here?

72
00:06:10,042 --> 00:06:11,532
I knew it

73
00:06:12,044 --> 00:06:14,740
This must be an abandoned
theme park

74
00:06:16,582 --> 00:06:20,018
They built so many
in the early '90s,

75
00:06:20,119 --> 00:06:22,587
but they all went down
with the economy

76
00:06:22,989 --> 00:06:25,321
This must be one of 'em

77
00:06:25,424 --> 00:06:27,392
What! No!

78
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:30,085
Let's go back, Daddy

79
00:06:33,099 --> 00:06:34,726
C'mon!

80
00:06:44,777 --> 00:06:47,405
Mommy, that building's moaning

81
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:48,512
It's just the wind

82
00:06:49,115 --> 00:06:50,912
What a lovely spot

83
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:53,517
We should've brought
our lunch with us

84
00:06:56,789 --> 00:06:58,586
They were making a river

85
00:07:03,963 --> 00:07:05,590
Hey, you smell that?

86
00:07:06,432 --> 00:07:08,400
See, it smells great

87
00:07:08,501 --> 00:07:09,593
You're right

88
00:07:09,702 --> 00:07:12,432
Maybe they're still open

89
00:07:12,805 --> 00:07:14,272
Hurry up, Chihiro

90
00:07:14,473 --> 00:07:16,532
Wait for me!

91
00:07:49,675 --> 00:07:50,972
This way

92
00:07:55,181 --> 00:07:58,617
Can you believe it,
they're all restaurants

93
00:07:58,718 --> 00:08:00,811
Where is everybody?

94
00:08:03,522 --> 00:08:04,819
Over there!

95
00:08:09,028 --> 00:08:11,155
Hey, hey!

96
00:08:22,341 --> 00:08:23,865
In here, here

97
00:08:26,545 --> 00:08:28,672
How amazing

98
00:08:28,848 --> 00:08:31,749
Hello, anybody here?

99
00:08:31,851 --> 00:08:34,251
Come in, Chihiro,
it looks delicious

100
00:08:34,687 --> 00:08:35,619
Hello!

101
00:08:40,726 --> 00:08:44,184
Oh, don't worry
We can pay them when they get back

102
00:08:44,363 --> 00:08:46,854
You're right
That one looks great...

103
00:08:47,032 --> 00:08:49,227
I wonder what this is called

104
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:53,634
Delicious! Chihiro, taste it

105
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,502
I don't want to!

106
00:08:55,608 --> 00:08:58,236
Let's go!
They're gonna be mad at us

107
00:08:58,711 --> 00:09:01,839
Don't worry,
you've got Daddy here

108
00:09:01,947 --> 00:09:04,040
I've got credit cards and cash

109
00:09:08,087 --> 00:09:10,817
Take some, Chihiro,
it's so tender

110
00:09:12,558 --> 00:09:13,525
Mustard

111
00:09:13,626 --> 00:09:14,388
Thank you

112
00:09:25,237 --> 00:09:27,831
Mommy!
Daddy!

113
00:10:37,176 --> 00:10:38,666
Weird...

114
00:11:08,707 --> 00:11:10,265
There's a train!

115
00:11:20,886 --> 00:11:22,683
You're not allowed here
Go back!

116
00:11:23,055 --> 00:11:23,680
Wha...?

117
00:11:23,856 --> 00:11:26,689
It's almost night!
Leave before it gets dark

118
00:11:29,461 --> 00:11:31,554
They're lighting the lamps
Go!

119
00:11:31,697 --> 00:11:34,188
I'll distract them
Get back across the river!

120
00:11:48,547 --> 00:11:50,572
What's his problem?

121
00:11:59,091 --> 00:12:00,251
Daddy!

122
00:12:01,393 --> 00:12:03,020
Daddy, let's go home

123
00:12:03,128 --> 00:12:04,720
Let's go, Daddy!

124
00:12:31,623 --> 00:12:34,592
Daddy!
Mommy!

125
00:12:44,136 --> 00:12:46,104
Mommy!

126
00:13:07,993 --> 00:13:09,460
It's water!

127
00:13:22,641 --> 00:13:23,903
This can't be...

128
00:13:24,009 --> 00:13:25,738
I'm dreaming, dreaming!

129
00:13:28,313 --> 00:13:30,543
Wake up! Wake up!

130
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:33,647
Wake... up...

131
00:13:38,991 --> 00:13:41,357
It's just a dream, a dream

132
00:13:41,994 --> 00:13:44,485
Go away, disappear

133
00:13:44,863 --> 00:13:46,262
Disappear

134
00:13:54,339 --> 00:13:55,772
I can see through!

135
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:01,008
It's a dream, it's got to be

136
00:14:53,966 --> 00:14:55,957
Don't be afraid, I'm a friend

137
00:14:56,535 --> 00:14:58,127
No, no, no!

138
00:14:58,704 --> 00:15:00,194
Open your mouth and eat this

139
00:15:00,706 --> 00:15:03,470
Unless you eat something
from this world, you'll vanish

140
00:15:03,575 --> 00:15:04,701
No!

141
00:15:08,881 --> 00:15:12,112
Don't worry
It won't turn you into a pig

142
00:15:12,217 --> 00:15:13,878
Chew it and swallow

143
00:15:24,229 --> 00:15:26,220
Good girl, you're fine

144
00:15:26,331 --> 00:15:27,730
See for yourself

145
00:15:36,074 --> 00:15:37,234
I'm back again...

146
00:15:37,342 --> 00:15:39,503
You see?
Now come

147
00:15:39,845 --> 00:15:43,679
What about my mom and dad? They
didn't really turn into pigs, did they?

148
00:15:44,183 --> 00:15:46,515
You can't see them now,
but you will

149
00:15:50,022 --> 00:15:50,681
Quiet!

150
00:16:08,941 --> 00:16:10,374
It's looking for you

151
00:16:10,475 --> 00:16:12,534
There's no time, let's run!

152
00:16:13,378 --> 00:16:15,938
I... I can't stand! Oh, no!

153
00:16:16,381 --> 00:16:17,473
My legs don't work

154
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:20,051
Calm, now
Take a deep breath

155
00:16:23,722 --> 00:16:27,749
In the name of the wind and
the water within thee... Unbind her

156
00:16:28,126 --> 00:16:29,093
Get up!

157
00:17:11,503 --> 00:17:14,472
Hold your breath while
we're on the bridge

158
00:17:15,841 --> 00:17:17,832
Even a tiny breath,

159
00:17:17,943 --> 00:17:20,935
will break the spell and
the attendants will see you

160
00:17:26,285 --> 00:17:27,513
I'm scared

161
00:17:27,619 --> 00:17:29,018
Be calm

162
00:17:29,354 --> 00:17:32,346
Welcome
Always nice to see you

163
00:17:32,457 --> 00:17:34,516
Welcome, welcome

164
00:17:35,127 --> 00:17:36,219
I'm back from my task

165
00:17:36,361 --> 00:17:38,022
Welcome back, sir

166
00:17:39,364 --> 00:17:41,127
A deep breath...

167
00:17:42,301 --> 00:17:43,359
And hold...

168
00:18:00,385 --> 00:18:03,980
Welcome back!
We missed you!

169
00:18:05,324 --> 00:18:07,019
Hang on, we're almost...

170
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:09,527
Master Haku!

171
00:18:10,395 --> 00:18:11,987
Where have you...

172
00:18:13,498 --> 00:18:15,159
Wha...
A human?

173
00:18:16,168 --> 00:18:17,328
Run!

174
00:18:19,404 --> 00:18:20,894
What...

175
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:36,251
Master Haku, Master Haku!

176
00:18:36,355 --> 00:18:39,017
Chase after it
A human intruder!

177
00:18:39,124 --> 00:18:41,354
I smell humans!
The stench of humans!

178
00:18:41,526 --> 00:18:42,322
They know you're here

179
00:18:42,427 --> 00:18:44,258
I'm sorry, I took a breath

180
00:18:44,363 --> 00:18:46,354
No, Chihiro, you did very well

181
00:18:46,765 --> 00:18:49,359
Listen and I'll
tell you what to do

182
00:18:49,468 --> 00:18:50,867
Stay here, and they'll find you

183
00:18:51,603 --> 00:18:54,936
I'll distract them
In the meantime, you escape

184
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:57,372
No, don't go!
Stay with me, please

185
00:18:58,210 --> 00:19:01,202
You have no choice,
if you want to survive here

186
00:19:01,313 --> 00:19:02,871
And save your parents, too

187
00:19:04,116 --> 00:19:06,778
So they did turn into pigs...
I wasn't dreaming...

188
00:19:06,885 --> 00:19:08,216
Be still...

189
00:19:09,287 --> 00:19:12,620
When things quiet down,
go out by the back gate

190
00:19:12,724 --> 00:19:15,488
Take the stairs, all the way down

191
00:19:15,594 --> 00:19:19,291
Until you reach the boiler room,
where they stoke the fires

192
00:19:19,398 --> 00:19:21,923
Kamaji's there, so look for him

193
00:19:23,568 --> 00:19:24,296
Kamaji?

194
00:19:25,637 --> 00:19:28,128
Ask him for work

195
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,571
Even if he refuses, insist

196
00:19:30,475 --> 00:19:33,569
If you don't work, Yubaba will
turn you into an animal

197
00:19:34,146 --> 00:19:35,477
Yubaba?

198
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:38,071
You'll see
She's the sorceress who rules our world

199
00:19:38,583 --> 00:19:41,882
Kamaji will turn you away,
trick you into you leaving,

200
00:19:41,987 --> 00:19:43,318
but keep on asking him for work

201
00:19:43,822 --> 00:19:46,313
It'll be hard work,
but it will give you a chance

202
00:19:46,425 --> 00:19:48,416
Then even Yubaba can't harm you

203
00:19:48,527 --> 00:19:49,323
OK

204
00:19:49,995 --> 00:19:52,327
Master Haku, Master Haku!

205
00:19:52,764 --> 00:19:53,924
I have to go

206
00:19:54,032 --> 00:19:56,592
Remember, Chihiro
I'm your friend

207
00:19:56,768 --> 00:19:58,099
How do you know my name?

208
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:00,601
I've known you
since you were small

209
00:20:01,006 --> 00:20:03,440
My name is Haku

210
00:20:05,844 --> 00:20:07,675
Here I am!

211
00:20:09,614 --> 00:20:11,844
Master Haku, Yubaba wants you

212
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:15,019
I know
It's about my task

213
00:24:23,201 --> 00:24:25,032
Um...

214
00:24:25,937 --> 00:24:27,564
Excuse me

215
00:24:34,112 --> 00:24:36,046
Um...

216
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:44,552
Um, are you Kamaji?

217
00:24:52,297 --> 00:24:55,892
Um, Haku sent me here
Please let me work here

218
00:25:00,405 --> 00:25:03,806
Darn, all at once...

219
00:25:04,476 --> 00:25:06,603
Get to work, you little runts

220
00:25:08,313 --> 00:25:10,474
I'm... Kamaji

221
00:25:10,582 --> 00:25:13,346
Slave to the boilers
that heat the baths

222
00:25:13,451 --> 00:25:15,749
Step on it, boys!

223
00:25:16,654 --> 00:25:18,622
Um, please let me work here!

224
00:25:18,823 --> 00:25:23,157
I've got all the help I need
The place is full of soot

225
00:25:23,261 --> 00:25:26,094
Plenty of replacements

226
00:25:40,678 --> 00:25:42,612
Oh, I'm sorry

227
00:25:46,284 --> 00:25:48,343
Please wait

228
00:26:00,198 --> 00:26:01,665
Outta the way!

229
00:26:54,752 --> 00:26:57,016
Um...
What should I do with this?

230
00:27:03,761 --> 00:27:05,251
Do I just leave it?

231
00:27:05,763 --> 00:27:07,754
Finish what you start!

232
00:27:42,967 --> 00:27:44,730
It's hot

233
00:28:07,659 --> 00:28:11,493
Hey, you runts!
Wanna turn back into soot?

234
00:28:11,596 --> 00:28:15,259
And you, watch it
You can't just take someone's job

235
00:28:15,433 --> 00:28:18,766
If they don't work,
the spell wears off

236
00:28:18,937 --> 00:28:21,963
Got no work for you here
Look elsewhere

237
00:28:31,115 --> 00:28:33,777
You sootballs got a problem?!

238
00:28:33,885 --> 00:28:35,182
Get to work! To work!

239
00:28:36,287 --> 00:28:38,278
Chow time

240
00:28:38,389 --> 00:28:40,687
What? You guys at it again?

241
00:28:42,694 --> 00:28:45,458
Cut it out
Where's your bowl?

242
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:48,591
I keep telling you
to leave it out

243
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:51,134
Meal time!
Take a break!

244
00:29:06,818 --> 00:29:08,979
A human! You're in trouble!

245
00:29:09,087 --> 00:29:11,555
They're having a fit
about it upstairs

246
00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:14,321
That's my granddaughter

247
00:29:14,425 --> 00:29:15,824
Granddaughter!?

248
00:29:16,728 --> 00:29:20,494
Says she wants to work,
but I've got all the help I need

249
00:29:20,598 --> 00:29:24,159
Would you take her to Yubaba?

250
00:29:24,335 --> 00:29:25,893
The girl can handle her, I'm sure

251
00:29:26,104 --> 00:29:28,664
Not a chance!
And risk my life!?

252
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:31,809
Take this, then
A roasted newt

253
00:29:31,909 --> 00:29:33,843
Real quality

254
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:39,616
If you want to work, you'll have
to make a deal with Yubaba

255
00:29:39,717 --> 00:29:41,844
Might as well try your luck

256
00:29:43,087 --> 00:29:45,851
Fine!
You there, follow me

257
00:29:52,263 --> 00:29:54,959
Can't you even manage a
"Yes ma'am," or "Thank you"?

258
00:29:55,066 --> 00:29:56,294
Yes... yes ma'am

259
00:29:56,401 --> 00:29:57,993
You sure are slow
Hurry!

260
00:29:58,102 --> 00:29:59,194
Yes ma'am

261
00:30:01,606 --> 00:30:04,598
What do you need shoes for!
Or socks!

262
00:30:04,709 --> 00:30:05,573
Yes ma'am!

263
00:30:11,215 --> 00:30:13,479
Did you even thank Kamaji?

264
00:30:13,584 --> 00:30:15,381
He's looking out for you

265
00:30:17,455 --> 00:30:19,286
Thank you very much, sir

266
00:30:20,892 --> 00:30:22,120
Good luck

267
00:30:32,003 --> 00:30:34,972
Yubaba lives way up at the top,
in the back

268
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,818
Get over here!

269
00:30:56,194 --> 00:30:57,991
You wanna lose your nose?

270
00:31:22,553 --> 00:31:24,043
We're almost there

271
00:31:24,155 --> 00:31:25,213
Right

272
00:31:29,727 --> 00:31:30,716
Here we are

273
00:31:34,232 --> 00:31:35,494
Wel... welcome!

274
00:31:41,572 --> 00:31:46,032
This elevator is not in service, sir
Please use another

275
00:32:08,699 --> 00:32:09,631
He's following us...

276
00:32:09,734 --> 00:32:11,361
Quit gawking

277
00:32:26,450 --> 00:32:28,918
Here we are

278
00:32:33,491 --> 00:32:35,925
Your room is on the right

279
00:32:38,796 --> 00:32:39,626
Lin?

280
00:32:39,730 --> 00:32:41,220
Yes!

281
00:32:42,633 --> 00:32:44,567
What's that smell?

282
00:32:45,069 --> 00:32:47,401
It's human
You reek of human

283
00:32:47,505 --> 00:32:48,130
Is that so?

284
00:32:48,973 --> 00:32:52,238
I smell it, I do
Smells mighty tasty, too

285
00:32:52,810 --> 00:32:55,244
You're hiding something

286
00:32:55,813 --> 00:32:57,747
Tell me the truth, now

287
00:32:57,848 --> 00:32:58,906
This smell?

288
00:32:59,584 --> 00:33:01,745
Roasted...
Gimme!

289
00:33:01,986 --> 00:33:05,080
Not a chance
It's for the other girls

290
00:33:05,423 --> 00:33:08,415
I'm begging you
I'll settle for a leg!

291
00:33:09,493 --> 00:33:12,326
Anyone going up,
pull down on the lever

292
00:34:57,868 --> 00:34:59,699
Not going to knock?!

293
00:35:00,604 --> 00:35:03,402
What a puny little girl

294
00:35:13,951 --> 00:35:15,714
Come closer...

295
00:35:19,223 --> 00:35:21,054
I said closer

296
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:37,901
Oww...

297
00:35:48,252 --> 00:35:50,982
You're making a racket
Keep it down

298
00:36:10,174 --> 00:36:11,141
Um...

299
00:36:11,675 --> 00:36:13,643
Please let me work here

300
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:25,489
Stop babbling

301
00:36:25,623 --> 00:36:28,615
You're just a useless weakling

302
00:36:29,026 --> 00:36:33,326
Besides, this is
no place for humans

303
00:36:34,465 --> 00:36:36,899
It's a bath house,

304
00:36:37,001 --> 00:36:40,994
where 8 million gods can
rest their weary bones

305
00:36:41,639 --> 00:36:44,972
Your parents had some nerve!

306
00:36:45,075 --> 00:36:48,511
Gobbling our guests'
food like pigs!

307
00:36:48,712 --> 00:36:50,839
Just desserts, I'd say

308
00:36:51,382 --> 00:36:54,317
And you'll never see...

309
00:36:54,485 --> 00:36:56,817
your world again either

310
00:37:00,391 --> 00:37:03,189
You'd make a lovely piglet

311
00:37:03,661 --> 00:37:06,323
Or maybe a lump of coal

312
00:37:14,238 --> 00:37:15,830
I see you're trembling

313
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:19,671
Actually, I'm impressed
you made it this far

314
00:37:19,844 --> 00:37:22,836
Someone must've helped you

315
00:37:23,347 --> 00:37:25,338
I must thank your friend

316
00:37:25,449 --> 00:37:29,909
Just who was it, my dear?
You can tell me

317
00:37:33,090 --> 00:37:34,523
Please let me work here!

318
00:37:34,758 --> 00:37:36,191
Not that again!

319
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:37,691
I want to work here!

320
00:37:38,195 --> 00:37:43,064
Shut Up!

321
00:37:46,704 --> 00:37:50,538
Why should I hire you?

322
00:37:50,641 --> 00:37:54,975
Anyone can see you're
a lazy, spoiled, crybaby

323
00:37:55,079 --> 00:37:57,513
Stupid to boot

324
00:37:57,615 --> 00:38:00,106
I've nothing for you

325
00:38:00,217 --> 00:38:02,208
Forget it

326
00:38:02,319 --> 00:38:05,982
I've got all the bums
I need around here

327
00:38:07,057 --> 00:38:11,289
Or maybe you'd like the worst,

328
00:38:11,395 --> 00:38:13,454
nastiest job I've got,

329
00:38:13,564 --> 00:38:18,467
until you breathe
your very last breath?!

330
00:38:31,148 --> 00:38:34,140
Stop that!
What's wrong...

331
00:38:35,152 --> 00:38:37,780
I'll be right there
That's a good baby, now

332
00:38:38,255 --> 00:38:40,655
What? You still here!
Get out!

333
00:38:41,091 --> 00:38:42,752
I want to work here!

334
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:45,287
Don't shout

335
00:38:46,697 --> 00:38:50,497
I'll be right there...

336
00:38:51,268 --> 00:38:53,759
That's a good baby,
there, there

337
00:38:54,171 --> 00:38:56,105
Please let me work!

338
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:59,138
OK, OK, just pipe down

339
00:38:59,510 --> 00:39:04,106
There, there, now

340
00:39:24,134 --> 00:39:25,863
Your contract

341
00:39:26,870 --> 00:39:28,861
Sign your name

342
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:31,007
I'll put you to work

343
00:39:31,709 --> 00:39:34,644
But one peep out of you
about anything,

344
00:39:34,745 --> 00:39:37,043
and I'll turn you
right into a piglet!

345
00:39:37,982 --> 00:39:40,143
Um, I sign my name here?

346
00:39:40,250 --> 00:39:43,549
That's right
Quit dilly-dallying and do it

347
00:39:48,225 --> 00:39:50,352
Unbelievable

348
00:39:50,894 --> 00:39:53,692
That ridiculous oath I took

349
00:39:55,232 --> 00:39:58,690
To give work to whoever asks

350
00:40:01,071 --> 00:40:01,730
Signed it?

351
00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:02,828
Yes

352
00:40:07,845 --> 00:40:09,176
You're Chihiro, huh?

353
00:40:09,346 --> 00:40:09,835
Yes

354
00:40:10,247 --> 00:40:12,875
What an extravagant name

355
00:40:22,359 --> 00:40:25,021
From now on, you'll be Sen

356
00:40:25,596 --> 00:40:27,393
You got that? You're Sen

357
00:40:27,531 --> 00:40:30,091
Answer me, Sen!

358
00:40:30,434 --> 00:40:31,696
Yes...

359
00:40:31,869 --> 00:40:33,268
Did you call?

360
00:40:36,273 --> 00:40:39,606
This child's starting work as of now
Look after her

361
00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:40,369
Yes

362
00:40:41,278 --> 00:40:42,245
Your name?

363
00:40:42,446 --> 00:40:43,344
What?

364
00:40:43,447 --> 00:40:46,041
Chi... Oh, I'm Sen

365
00:40:46,450 --> 00:40:48,577
Follow me, then, Sen

366
00:40:57,127 --> 00:40:58,287
Haku... Um...

367
00:40:58,796 --> 00:41:00,457
No idle chatter

368
00:41:00,564 --> 00:41:03,124
Call me Master Haku

369
00:41:18,582 --> 00:41:21,915
Even on Yubaba's orders...

370
00:41:22,086 --> 00:41:23,451
We can't allow humans

371
00:41:24,154 --> 00:41:25,644
Her contract's signed

372
00:41:25,756 --> 00:41:26,415
What...?

373
00:41:26,523 --> 00:41:27,820
Thank you, everyone

374
00:41:28,258 --> 00:41:31,591
Don't send her to us
Can't bear that human stink

375
00:41:32,496 --> 00:41:35,431
Three days of eating our food
and her smell will vanish

376
00:41:35,532 --> 00:41:39,696
If she's still useless then, fry her,
boil her, do with her as you will

377
00:41:41,505 --> 00:41:43,598
Back to work!
Where's Lin?

378
00:41:44,007 --> 00:41:46,100
Don't dump her on me!

379
00:41:46,777 --> 00:41:48,108
You wanted help

380
00:41:48,278 --> 00:41:51,213
That's right, Lin's just perfect

381
00:41:51,515 --> 00:41:52,607
Go, Sen

382
00:41:52,716 --> 00:41:54,183
Yes sir

383
00:41:54,518 --> 00:41:57,681
What a pain
You're gonna pay for this

384
00:41:58,355 --> 00:41:59,822
Off you go!

385
00:42:02,359 --> 00:42:03,621
C'mon

386
00:42:12,469 --> 00:42:13,834
So you pulled it off, huh?!

387
00:42:14,638 --> 00:42:16,629
You're so thick,
I was worried

388
00:42:17,141 --> 00:42:20,804
Keep your wits, now
If you need something, ask me, OK?

389
00:42:22,713 --> 00:42:24,146
What's wrong

390
00:42:25,215 --> 00:42:27,149
I'm dizzy

391
00:42:31,722 --> 00:42:33,815
So this is our room

392
00:42:34,892 --> 00:42:37,190
Chow, then bed,
you'll be fine

393
00:42:40,230 --> 00:42:43,324
You wash your own apron!
Trousers!

394
00:42:44,168 --> 00:42:46,329
You're so puny

395
00:42:47,004 --> 00:42:48,494
Too big...

396
00:42:50,574 --> 00:42:52,166
Um, Lin...

397
00:42:52,276 --> 00:42:53,265
What?

398
00:42:53,377 --> 00:42:55,345
Are there two Hakus here?

399
00:42:55,746 --> 00:42:56,906
Two?!

400
00:42:57,014 --> 00:42:59,539
Of him? I sure hope not

401
00:42:59,750 --> 00:43:00,717
Still too big

402
00:43:00,851 --> 00:43:03,513
He's Yubaba's henchman
Watch out for him

403
00:43:07,024 --> 00:43:09,185
Where the...

404
00:43:09,927 --> 00:43:12,054
Here it is

405
00:43:13,430 --> 00:43:17,526
What's wrong?
Are you OK?

406
00:43:18,435 --> 00:43:20,869
What's all the fuss, Lin?

407
00:43:20,971 --> 00:43:23,439
New girl
Says she feels faint

408
00:44:55,265 --> 00:44:59,725
Meet me at the bridge
I'll show you your mother and father

409
00:45:43,814 --> 00:45:44,712
My shoes...

410
00:45:59,162 --> 00:46:00,720
Thank you

411
00:47:09,232 --> 00:47:10,699
Follow me

412
00:47:53,743 --> 00:47:56,268
Daddy, Mommy, it's me!

413
00:47:56,947 --> 00:47:58,005
It's Sen

414
00:47:59,082 --> 00:48:01,448
Mommy, Daddy!

415
00:48:04,454 --> 00:48:06,319
Are they sick or hurt?

416
00:48:06,423 --> 00:48:09,017
No, they ate too much
Sleeping it off

417
00:48:09,926 --> 00:48:12,793
They don't even remember
being human

418
00:48:18,468 --> 00:48:21,062
Daddy, Mommy,
I promise I'll save you!

419
00:48:21,171 --> 00:48:24,265
Don't get too fat,
or they'll eat you!

420
00:48:32,482 --> 00:48:34,279
Hide these

421
00:48:36,987 --> 00:48:38,147
I thought they were gone

422
00:48:38,822 --> 00:48:40,619
You'll need them to get home

423
00:48:46,796 --> 00:48:49,230
This was a farewell card...

424
00:48:50,534 --> 00:48:51,899
Chi-hi-ro

425
00:48:52,469 --> 00:48:55,563
Chihiro...
That's my name

426
00:48:56,673 --> 00:48:58,903
Yubaba rules others by
stealing their names

427
00:48:59,809 --> 00:49:03,905
You're Sen here, but keep your
real name a secret

428
00:49:04,181 --> 00:49:07,150
She almost got mine
I'd nearly turned into Sen

429
00:49:08,185 --> 00:49:11,484
If she steals your name, you'll
never find your way home

430
00:49:12,355 --> 00:49:14,653
I no longer remember mine

431
00:49:15,025 --> 00:49:16,652
Your real name?

432
00:49:17,027 --> 00:49:20,485
But it's strange
I remembered yours

433
00:49:22,832 --> 00:49:25,562
Go ahead, eat,
you must be hungry

434
00:49:25,669 --> 00:49:27,261
I don't want to

435
00:49:27,370 --> 00:49:31,329
I put a spell on it to give you
back your strength, eat it

436
00:50:08,078 --> 00:50:10,569
You've had a hard time
Eat some more

437
00:50:25,428 --> 00:50:26,827
Can you find your way back?

438
00:50:26,930 --> 00:50:29,524
Yes, Haku, thank you
I'll work very hard

439
00:50:29,633 --> 00:50:30,895
Good

440
00:52:04,494 --> 00:52:06,962
Where were you?
I was worried

441
00:52:07,063 --> 00:52:08,155
I'm sorry

442
00:52:17,574 --> 00:52:19,337
Outta my way

443
00:52:32,389 --> 00:52:34,619
That the best you can do?

444
00:52:35,024 --> 00:52:37,458
You and Sen get
the big tub as of today

445
00:52:37,894 --> 00:52:39,862
What! But that's Frog work!

446
00:52:40,029 --> 00:52:42,964
Orders from the top
Better give it your all

447
00:53:03,219 --> 00:53:04,982
Aren't you... getting wet?

448
00:53:09,259 --> 00:53:10,851
Hurry up, Sen!

449
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:12,291
Coming!

450
00:53:12,395 --> 00:53:14,386
I'll leave this open

451
00:53:42,091 --> 00:53:43,149
On the big tub, Lin?

452
00:53:43,259 --> 00:53:43,918
Lay off me

453
00:53:47,263 --> 00:53:50,790
Jerks!
They haven't scrubbed this in ages!

454
00:54:05,315 --> 00:54:08,614
This bath is reserved
for our filthiest guests

455
00:54:08,785 --> 00:54:10,218
It's caked with sludge

456
00:54:10,653 --> 00:54:12,951
Lin, Sen, first customers are here

457
00:54:13,323 --> 00:54:14,950
Right away...

458
00:54:15,124 --> 00:54:17,251
Shoot, clearly harassment

459
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:20,454
This tub needs an herbal soak
Get a tag from the foreman

460
00:54:20,630 --> 00:54:21,619
A tag?

461
00:54:24,501 --> 00:54:26,469
An herbal soak tag

462
00:54:26,636 --> 00:54:27,898
Right

463
00:54:29,005 --> 00:54:30,563
What's a foreman, Lin?

464
00:54:34,677 --> 00:54:37,646
Something's coming
I wonder what

465
00:54:46,689 --> 00:54:50,489
Some useless scum,
under cover of rainfall...

466
00:55:14,751 --> 00:55:17,413
I can't waste that on you!

467
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:19,351
Why good morning!

468
00:55:19,689 --> 00:55:21,520
Feeling refreshed?

469
00:55:22,058 --> 00:55:23,184
For Kasuga sama

470
00:55:23,359 --> 00:55:25,554
One deluxe sulfur soak

471
00:55:25,728 --> 00:55:28,196
No point in standing there
Back to work!

472
00:55:28,731 --> 00:55:30,494
Scrub with your hands

473
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:32,261
Good morning

474
00:55:32,368 --> 00:55:33,198
Your hands, I say

475
00:55:33,403 --> 00:55:36,702
But... Um...
It has to be an herbal soak

476
00:55:36,906 --> 00:55:38,498
You sure are dense

477
00:55:38,608 --> 00:55:42,704
Oh... A fragrant bath coming up
Relax and enjoy...

478
00:55:51,921 --> 00:55:54,549
Hello, foreman here
Yes, ma'am...

479
00:55:56,759 --> 00:55:57,783
Thank you so much!

480
00:55:57,894 --> 00:55:59,054
That's not...

481
00:55:59,228 --> 00:56:00,593
Hey, you, wait!

482
00:56:00,730 --> 00:56:01,719
What's the trouble?

483
00:56:01,831 --> 00:56:03,059
Why, nothing at all...

484
00:56:03,566 --> 00:56:05,124
We have an intruder

485
00:56:05,234 --> 00:56:06,166
Is it human?

486
00:56:06,269 --> 00:56:09,067
You figure it out
Haku's out today

487
00:56:09,405 --> 00:56:11,873
Wow, you got a really good one

488
00:56:11,975 --> 00:56:14,409
This goes to Kamaji

489
00:56:16,112 --> 00:56:17,739
Water'll be right up,
it's not too busy now

490
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:26,855
Yank on this for hot water

491
00:56:35,632 --> 00:56:37,896
You're such a klutz

492
00:56:38,001 --> 00:56:40,094
Look at that color

493
00:56:40,203 --> 00:56:42,364
That's the dried worm salts

494
00:56:43,106 --> 00:56:46,041
With water this murky
who's gonna see the sludge

495
00:56:48,144 --> 00:56:50,942
Yank it again when it's full
It'll stop

496
00:56:51,447 --> 00:56:53,074
Go ahead, let go

497
00:56:53,182 --> 00:56:54,774
I'll get our breakfast

498
00:56:54,884 --> 00:56:56,112
Sure!

499
00:57:18,474 --> 00:57:21,136
Ouch!

500
00:57:24,647 --> 00:57:27,241
Um...
The bath's not ready yet

501
00:57:32,855 --> 00:57:34,152
But, there are so many...

502
00:57:37,026 --> 00:57:38,823
Wha...
They're for me?

503
00:57:42,198 --> 00:57:44,428
But...
I don't need this many

504
00:57:47,336 --> 00:57:48,928
No, just one

505
00:58:04,387 --> 00:58:05,012
Madam!

506
00:58:05,121 --> 00:58:06,452
It's a Stink God?!

507
00:58:06,556 --> 00:58:08,649
An Extra Large Stinker at that

508
00:58:08,758 --> 00:58:10,385
Headed straight for the bridge

509
00:58:10,593 --> 00:58:12,891
Please turn back

510
00:58:13,730 --> 00:58:16,893
Please withdraw!
The bath is closed for the night

511
00:58:17,266 --> 00:58:19,734
Please withdraw, please!

512
00:58:19,902 --> 00:58:22,427
Peeeee-ewy...

513
00:58:22,905 --> 00:58:26,636
Something's fishy
Didn't seem like a Stink God, to me...

514
00:58:26,743 --> 00:58:29,177
Well, now that it's here,
better go greet it!

515
00:58:29,979 --> 00:58:33,471
Just try to get rid of it,
as fast as you can

516
00:58:34,016 --> 00:58:36,610
Please retire to your rooms!
So terribly sorry!

517
00:58:36,786 --> 00:58:37,684
Please hurry!

518
00:58:39,956 --> 00:58:41,890
Lin and Sen, Yubaba's calling

519
00:58:41,991 --> 00:58:42,685
Yes sir!

520
00:58:43,092 --> 00:58:45,652
Listen, this is your first job

521
00:58:45,762 --> 00:58:48,424
You take this customer
in the big tub

522
00:58:48,798 --> 00:58:49,423
Um... um...

523
00:58:49,599 --> 00:58:51,430
One peep out of you
and you're coal!

524
00:58:51,801 --> 00:58:52,529
Got that?

525
00:58:52,668 --> 00:58:54,602
It has arrived

526
00:59:05,114 --> 00:59:06,979
Don't insult the customer!

527
00:59:15,158 --> 00:59:18,889
Welggum to our bazzs...

528
00:59:21,998 --> 00:59:23,966
Oh...
Money...!

529
00:59:24,133 --> 00:59:26,693
Sen, hurry, take it!

530
00:59:26,803 --> 00:59:28,361
Yes ma'am

531
00:59:36,345 --> 00:59:40,941
Zhow him de bazz

532
00:59:41,050 --> 00:59:42,813
Pl... Pleazze

533
01:00:01,370 --> 01:00:03,167
Sen!

534
01:00:07,276 --> 01:00:09,744
Awful...

535
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:11,710
Our food...

536
01:00:11,914 --> 01:00:13,939
Open the windows!
All of 'em!

537
01:00:57,260 --> 01:01:00,161
What?
Just a minute

538
01:01:05,568 --> 01:01:06,694
Truly filthy, no?

539
01:01:06,802 --> 01:01:08,326
This is no laughing matter

540
01:01:08,437 --> 01:01:09,904
Let's see what she does

541
01:01:14,610 --> 01:01:17,204
Ah, she intends to re-fill the tub

542
01:01:17,313 --> 01:01:21,147
Oh, no, soiling the walls
with those filthy hands!

543
01:01:33,296 --> 01:01:35,093
Did you give Sen new tags?

544
01:01:35,264 --> 01:01:37,960
Never, what a waste!

545
01:02:19,308 --> 01:02:21,674
Oh no!
All that precious herbal formula!

546
01:02:47,870 --> 01:02:49,667
Sen! Sen, where are you!

547
01:02:50,339 --> 01:02:51,237
Lin!

548
01:02:51,340 --> 01:02:52,500
You OK?

549
01:02:52,608 --> 01:02:55,168
I asked Kamaji to give us
all the water he's got!

550
01:02:55,845 --> 01:02:57,836
He's sending the best
herbal soak ever!

551
01:02:58,381 --> 01:03:01,578
Thank you
He's got a thorn stuck in him

552
01:03:01,684 --> 01:03:02,673
A thorn!?

553
01:03:02,785 --> 01:03:04,343
It's in so deep, it won't come out!

554
01:03:04,687 --> 01:03:07,212
Thorn!?
She said thorn!

555
01:03:08,524 --> 01:03:10,424
Rally the help downstairs!

556
01:03:10,526 --> 01:03:11,185
Step on it!

557
01:03:14,897 --> 01:03:16,364
Sen and Lin!

558
01:03:16,532 --> 01:03:18,864
that's no Stink God in there!

559
01:03:21,070 --> 01:03:22,537
Grab this rope!

560
01:03:22,705 --> 01:03:23,763
Yes ma'am!

561
01:03:32,581 --> 01:03:34,048
Hold on tight!

562
01:03:34,216 --> 01:03:35,148
Yes ma'am!

563
01:03:35,651 --> 01:03:39,212
Hustle now, and get
the women to help them

564
01:03:39,622 --> 01:03:41,214
I tied it!

565
01:03:42,391 --> 01:03:45,883
Everyone, all of you!
All together now!

566
01:03:45,995 --> 01:03:48,725
Heave!

567
01:03:49,432 --> 01:03:51,229
And heave!

568
01:03:51,567 --> 01:03:53,728
And heave!

569
01:03:53,903 --> 01:03:56,064
And heave!

570
01:04:03,913 --> 01:04:04,743
A bicycle?

571
01:04:05,448 --> 01:04:06,574
As I suspected!
Now, pull!

572
01:04:06,749 --> 01:04:08,740
Now, heave!

573
01:04:09,085 --> 01:04:11,519
And heave!

574
01:04:43,152 --> 01:04:45,643
Sen, you OK!?

575
01:04:56,132 --> 01:04:59,329
Well done...

576
01:05:28,197 --> 01:05:30,097
Gold! Gold!
It's gold!

577
01:05:30,499 --> 01:05:32,990
Hands off!
That's company property!

578
01:05:33,202 --> 01:05:36,603
Be still
Our guest is still with us

579
01:05:42,545 --> 01:05:45,514
Sen, you're in our guest's way
Get out and open the door

580
01:05:45,681 --> 01:05:48,047
Open the main gates!
He's leaving!

581
01:06:14,910 --> 01:06:18,971
Sen! You did great!
You made us a bundle!

582
01:06:19,748 --> 01:06:22,342
That River God's famous

583
01:06:22,451 --> 01:06:24,043
You can all learn from Sen

584
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:26,915
Sake's on the house, tonight!

585
01:06:27,223 --> 01:06:30,090
Now! Time to hand over all
that gold you picked up!

586
01:06:43,505 --> 01:06:45,473
Want some?
I swiped it

587
01:06:46,008 --> 01:06:47,407
Thank you

588
01:06:47,576 --> 01:06:49,669
Man, oh, man

589
01:06:52,281 --> 01:06:53,748
I didn't see Haku

590
01:06:53,916 --> 01:06:55,577
Not Haku again

591
01:06:56,585 --> 01:06:59,019
He just disappears sometimes

592
01:06:59,421 --> 01:07:03,118
They say Yubaba makes
him do bad stuff

593
01:07:03,292 --> 01:07:04,088
Really...

594
01:07:04,260 --> 01:07:05,659
Lights out, Lin

595
01:07:05,761 --> 01:07:06,989
Right

596
01:07:31,987 --> 01:07:34,615
There's a town
Looks like the ocean...

597
01:07:34,957 --> 01:07:37,721
What did you expect
after all that rain

598
01:07:39,662 --> 01:07:43,621
Some day, I swear I'll get to that town
I'm gonna get out of here

599
01:08:07,189 --> 01:08:09,419
What's wrong!

600
01:08:39,054 --> 01:08:40,521
Gold!

601
01:08:43,392 --> 01:08:46,486
Who are you?
You're no customer

602
01:08:46,595 --> 01:08:48,187
You're not allowed in there!

603
01:08:54,903 --> 01:08:57,963
Hey! It's gold, gold!
It's for me!?

604
01:09:03,379 --> 01:09:05,643
You can make gold?

605
01:09:11,253 --> 01:09:12,083
Gimme!

606
01:09:20,729 --> 01:09:22,060
Who goes there?

607
01:09:23,265 --> 01:09:25,495
It's way past bedtime

608
01:09:29,104 --> 01:09:32,267
Hey boss, I'm hungry

609
01:09:32,474 --> 01:09:33,668
Starving

610
01:09:33,776 --> 01:09:34,640
That voice...

611
01:09:34,743 --> 01:09:36,574
There, I'll pay you now

612
01:09:37,413 --> 01:09:40,007
I'm a customer, I want a bath!

613
01:09:40,149 --> 01:09:41,673
Wake everyone up!

614
01:09:47,289 --> 01:09:50,588
Mommy, Daddy, the River God
gave me this cake

615
01:09:50,759 --> 01:09:53,694
I'm sure if you eat it,
you'll turn back into people

616
01:09:57,766 --> 01:09:59,791
Dad, Mom, where are you?

617
01:10:00,135 --> 01:10:01,261
Daddy!

618
01:10:12,481 --> 01:10:13,539
Bad dream

619
01:10:15,150 --> 01:10:16,617
Lin...?

620
01:10:20,489 --> 01:10:22,116
Where is everybody?

621
01:10:28,664 --> 01:10:31,394
Wow... it really did
turn into an ocean!

622
01:10:36,805 --> 01:10:39,672
I can see where Mom and
Dad are from here

623
01:10:43,479 --> 01:10:45,606
Kamaji's already lit the fires?

624
01:10:45,714 --> 01:10:47,807
Did I sleep that long?

625
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:53,988
The customer's waiting
Hurry it up!

626
01:10:54,256 --> 01:10:58,158
Serve everything you've
got, even leftovers!

627
01:11:00,195 --> 01:11:01,127
Sen!

628
01:11:01,230 --> 01:11:02,356
Lin

629
01:11:02,498 --> 01:11:05,092
I was just going to wake you up
Look!

630
01:11:05,501 --> 01:11:07,594
Real gold
He gave it to me

631
01:11:08,036 --> 01:11:10,095
This guest's a real high roller

632
01:11:10,339 --> 01:11:12,569
Please, sir, try this!

633
01:11:12,674 --> 01:11:15,074
Taste the very best!

634
01:11:16,712 --> 01:11:19,203
Throw us some gold!

635
01:11:20,549 --> 01:11:21,174
Your blessings!

636
01:11:21,350 --> 01:11:24,615
I'm starving, bring it all!

637
01:11:25,354 --> 01:11:27,686
Please sir!

638
01:11:29,358 --> 01:11:30,518
That guest...

639
01:11:30,893 --> 01:11:34,294
Come, Sen, Yubaba's still asleep
Now's your chance

640
01:11:34,730 --> 01:11:36,527
I'm going to see Kamaji

641
01:11:37,199 --> 01:11:39,360
I wouldn't go right now

642
01:11:39,468 --> 01:11:41,959
He's in a foul mood
'cause they woke him up

643
01:11:42,070 --> 01:11:43,867
Let's go back for more, Lin

644
01:12:08,931 --> 01:12:12,332
What if I don't recognize
my parents?

645
01:12:13,068 --> 01:12:15,832
I hope Dad hasn't
gotten too fat

646
01:12:44,099 --> 01:12:45,464
The dragon I saw before

647
01:12:46,134 --> 01:12:47,761
It's coming this way!

648
01:12:50,305 --> 01:12:51,533
What are they?
Not birds

649
01:13:03,018 --> 01:13:06,044
Fight back, Haku!
This way

650
01:13:06,221 --> 01:13:07,017
Haku!

651
01:13:07,689 --> 01:13:08,781
Haku!

652
01:13:27,009 --> 01:13:29,307
Oh...
It's just paper...

653
01:13:57,673 --> 01:13:59,766
Haku?
That is you, right?

654
01:14:06,014 --> 01:14:09,313
Are you hurt?
Those paper birds are gone

655
01:14:09,418 --> 01:14:10,680
You're safe, now

656
01:14:23,899 --> 01:14:25,526
He's going to Yubaba...

657
01:14:26,234 --> 01:14:28,566
Oh, no!
He'll die!

658
01:14:36,578 --> 01:14:40,981
<i>The very richest man
in the whole wide world</i>

659
01:14:41,349 --> 01:14:45,149
<i>That man himself,
is now approaching</i>

660
01:14:46,488 --> 01:14:48,547
Welcome!

661
01:14:48,657 --> 01:14:50,989
<i>Time to beg for tips
Start begging</i>

662
01:14:51,093 --> 01:14:53,994
Please, sir! Over here!

663
01:14:54,162 --> 01:14:56,892
Now beg

664
01:14:56,998 --> 01:14:58,659
Now beg

665
01:14:58,834 --> 01:15:00,665
Gold springs from his palms

666
01:15:01,503 --> 01:15:04,768
Toss some this way, sir!

667
01:15:08,710 --> 01:15:10,143
Hey, what are you doing?

668
01:15:10,245 --> 01:15:11,234
I'm going upstairs

669
01:15:11,346 --> 01:15:13,337
No, you don't
What's this!

670
01:15:14,049 --> 01:15:15,175
It's blood!

671
01:15:19,221 --> 01:15:21,416
Move, move
Let our guest through

672
01:15:23,058 --> 01:15:24,958
Thank you for helping me before

673
01:15:25,227 --> 01:15:27,627
Don't just stand there...

674
01:15:49,584 --> 01:15:51,142
I don't want any
Don't need any

675
01:15:54,222 --> 01:15:56,747
I'm busy, please excuse me

676
01:16:08,136 --> 01:16:10,900
Quiet! Quiet down!

677
01:16:11,740 --> 01:16:13,332
Back, get back!

678
01:16:13,775 --> 01:16:15,766
Please forgive her manners

679
01:16:15,977 --> 01:16:19,606
After all, the girl is only human
and new here...

680
01:16:21,950 --> 01:16:23,747
Wipe that smile off your face

681
01:16:23,919 --> 01:16:24,715
I saw that look

682
01:16:24,820 --> 01:16:26,287
Why, I would never...

683
01:16:31,259 --> 01:16:33,523
<i>He ate them!</i>

684
01:18:00,548 --> 01:18:02,015
Yubaba?

685
01:19:14,622 --> 01:19:17,523
We're in a fine mess, now

686
01:19:17,926 --> 01:19:20,053
Actually, he's a No Face

687
01:19:20,161 --> 01:19:21,958
That's right, a No Face!

688
01:19:22,430 --> 01:19:25,194
Your greed attracted
quite a guest, all right

689
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:29,031
Don't do anything stupid
until I get down there

690
01:19:29,637 --> 01:19:32,071
Look, the carpet's a mess

691
01:19:32,173 --> 01:19:34,437
Get Haku out of here

692
01:19:34,542 --> 01:19:36,271
He's no use to me now

693
01:19:58,900 --> 01:20:01,835
Sleeping outside of
your crib again?

694
01:20:05,907 --> 01:20:10,139
Oh, I'm sorry, you were
sleeping like such a good baby

695
01:20:10,311 --> 01:20:13,075
Baba still has work to do

696
01:20:16,051 --> 01:20:18,815
Go back to sleep now
Good baby

697
01:20:47,215 --> 01:20:48,944
Ouch, let go!

698
01:20:49,217 --> 01:20:51,082
Oh, thank you for helping me

699
01:20:51,186 --> 01:20:54,519
But I'm in a hurry
Please let me go

700
01:20:54,622 --> 01:20:57,182
You came here to make me sick

701
01:20:57,525 --> 01:20:59,959
Bad germs outside, bad

702
01:21:00,962 --> 01:21:04,693
I'm a human
Maybe you never saw one before

703
01:21:05,066 --> 01:21:07,364
You'll get sick out there

704
01:21:07,535 --> 01:21:09,469
Stay here and play with me

705
01:21:09,737 --> 01:21:11,329
Are you sick?

706
01:21:11,439 --> 01:21:14,272
I'm in here 'cause
I'll get sick outside

707
01:21:14,375 --> 01:21:16,866
It's staying in here that'll
make you sick!

708
01:21:16,978 --> 01:21:20,709
You see, somebody I really
care about got hurt very badly

709
01:21:20,882 --> 01:21:22,509
So I've got to go right now

710
01:21:22,617 --> 01:21:23,879
Please let go of my arm!

711
01:21:24,219 --> 01:21:25,846
If you go, I'll start crying

712
01:21:25,954 --> 01:21:29,390
If I cry, Baba will come
and kill you

713
01:21:29,557 --> 01:21:31,184
I'll break your little arm

714
01:21:31,292 --> 01:21:32,486
That hurts!

715
01:21:32,594 --> 01:21:34,994
Please, I'll come
play with you later

716
01:21:35,263 --> 01:21:36,730
No, I wanna play now!

717
01:21:40,902 --> 01:21:42,995
That's blood! Get it!
It's blood!

718
01:21:54,616 --> 01:21:56,277
Haku!

719
01:21:56,484 --> 01:21:58,577
Stop, go away!
Scat, scat!

720
01:21:58,686 --> 01:21:59,618
Haku! It is you, right?!

721
01:21:59,821 --> 01:22:01,288
Hang on!

722
01:22:01,756 --> 01:22:03,917
Be quiet!
Haku!

723
01:22:09,631 --> 01:22:10,598
Shoo, shoo, go away

724
01:22:13,434 --> 01:22:14,696
Oh, no!

725
01:22:29,817 --> 01:22:31,580
I'm not afraid of blood

726
01:22:31,686 --> 01:22:33,449
I'll cry if you don't play

727
01:22:33,655 --> 01:22:35,452
Please be a good boy and wait

728
01:22:35,990 --> 01:22:38,959
If you don't play with me,
I'll cry...

729
01:22:40,995 --> 01:22:42,394
Please, wait!

730
01:22:42,530 --> 01:22:45,693
What a racket
Simmer down

731
01:22:47,135 --> 01:22:49,899
You're a little butterball,
aren't you?

732
01:22:57,345 --> 01:22:59,609
Guess I'm still a little transparent

733
01:22:59,714 --> 01:23:00,476
Baba

734
01:23:01,182 --> 01:23:05,243
Oh, dear, can't you even tell
me from your own mother?

735
01:23:13,494 --> 01:23:16,395
There, that gives you
a little more freedom

736
01:23:16,497 --> 01:23:17,156
Let's see now...

737
01:23:17,665 --> 01:23:19,496
What shall we turn you into?

738
01:23:37,685 --> 01:23:40,347
This is our little secret
You tell anyone,

739
01:23:40,521 --> 01:23:42,386
and I'll rip your mouth out

740
01:23:44,058 --> 01:23:45,184
Who are you?

741
01:23:45,393 --> 01:23:47,827
Yubaba's twin sister

742
01:23:47,929 --> 01:23:51,922
Thanks to you, I've had a good
look at this place, enjoyed myself

743
01:23:52,033 --> 01:23:53,694
Now hand over the dragon

744
01:23:53,968 --> 01:23:56,300
What do you want with Haku?
He's badly hurt

745
01:23:56,738 --> 01:23:59,707
That dragon's a thief,
my sister's lackey

746
01:23:59,874 --> 01:24:02,900
Stole a precious seal
from my house

747
01:24:03,111 --> 01:24:05,807
Haku would never!
He's so kind

748
01:24:06,414 --> 01:24:09,975
All dragons are kind
Kind and stupid

749
01:24:10,118 --> 01:24:14,555
Eager to learn my sister's
magical ways

750
01:24:15,089 --> 01:24:18,855
This boy here will do anything
that greedy woman wants

751
01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:21,053
Move away

752
01:24:21,162 --> 01:24:23,630
It's too late for him anyway

753
01:24:23,765 --> 01:24:26,893
The seal was protected
by a charm...

754
01:24:27,068 --> 01:24:29,059
Any who try to steal it must die

755
01:24:29,837 --> 01:24:31,566
No, you can't!

756
01:24:39,113 --> 01:24:41,138
What's gotten into them?

757
01:24:41,249 --> 01:24:43,843
Hey there, cut it out!
Go back to your room

758
01:24:51,759 --> 01:24:53,954
Oh, dear, seems I was careless

759
01:24:54,395 --> 01:24:55,453
Haku!
Oh, no!

760
01:25:16,951 --> 01:25:17,975
Haku!

761
01:25:46,147 --> 01:25:47,774
What on earth is this!

762
01:25:47,882 --> 01:25:49,247
Hey!
Just wait

763
01:25:52,320 --> 01:25:53,480
Haku!

764
01:25:57,024 --> 01:25:58,582
Does it hurt?

765
01:26:02,263 --> 01:26:04,322
This is serious

766
01:26:06,367 --> 01:26:07,664
Haku, don't give up!

767
01:26:07,769 --> 01:26:09,430
Oh, no, he's going to die!

768
01:26:10,037 --> 01:26:12,801
There's something inside him
that's killing him

769
01:26:12,907 --> 01:26:14,067
Inside him!?

770
01:26:14,175 --> 01:26:17,338
It's a good spell
Nothing I can do

771
01:26:17,712 --> 01:26:21,011
Haku, the River God
gave me this

772
01:26:21,182 --> 01:26:23,207
Eat it, maybe it'll help

773
01:26:25,553 --> 01:26:27,680
Haku, open your mouth!

774
01:26:28,055 --> 01:26:30,615
Please, Haku, eat it!

775
01:26:32,393 --> 01:26:34,054
See, it's safe

776
01:26:34,529 --> 01:26:36,463
Is it an herbal cake?

777
01:26:36,864 --> 01:26:39,799
Open
That's a good boy...

778
01:26:43,704 --> 01:26:45,399
That's it

779
01:26:45,540 --> 01:26:46,939
Swallow!

780
01:27:05,393 --> 01:27:06,587
He spit it out!
That's it!

781
01:27:19,440 --> 01:27:20,566
The seal!

782
01:27:20,775 --> 01:27:22,572
It got away!
There! Over there!

783
01:27:42,430 --> 01:27:44,921
Gross, gross, Sen!
Totally gross

784
01:27:49,270 --> 01:27:50,168
Clean!

785
01:27:50,271 --> 01:27:52,933
Haku took this from
Yubaba's sister, Kamaji

786
01:27:53,441 --> 01:27:55,966
From Zeniba?
A witch's seal!

787
01:27:56,511 --> 01:27:58,672
Precious loot, I'd say

788
01:28:01,215 --> 01:28:03,115
Oh...
I knew it was Haku!

789
01:28:03,284 --> 01:28:04,808
Look, Kamaji, it's Haku!

790
01:28:07,054 --> 01:28:08,043
Haku!

791
01:28:08,155 --> 01:28:09,554
Haku! Haku!

792
01:28:11,993 --> 01:28:13,961
Kamaji! He's not breathing

793
01:28:14,128 --> 01:28:17,564
Yes he is, but he's still
gravely ill from the spell...

794
01:28:26,974 --> 01:28:29,909
That should calm him some

795
01:28:32,346 --> 01:28:37,283
Haku turned up one day here,
just like you

796
01:28:37,385 --> 01:28:40,377
Said he wanted to learn magic

797
01:28:40,488 --> 01:28:42,479
I didn't approve...

798
01:28:42,657 --> 01:28:43,988
becoming a sorcerer's apprentice...

799
01:28:44,091 --> 01:28:46,252
and I warned him,

800
01:28:46,694 --> 01:28:49,162
but he wouldn't listen

801
01:28:49,497 --> 01:28:51,124
Said he had nowhere left to go

802
01:28:51,232 --> 01:28:54,724
Signed up to be
Yubaba's apprentice

803
01:28:55,269 --> 01:28:58,329
As time went by,
he turned increasingly pale,

804
01:28:58,506 --> 01:29:01,373
and his eyes took on
a sharp gleam

805
01:29:03,678 --> 01:29:07,341
Kamaji, I'm going to give
this back to Yubaba's sister

806
01:29:07,548 --> 01:29:11,314
Give it back, apologize,
and ask her to help Haku

807
01:29:11,419 --> 01:29:13,182
Tell me where she lives

808
01:29:13,721 --> 01:29:16,019
Go to Zeniba's?

809
01:29:16,524 --> 01:29:18,424
She's one scary sorceress

810
01:29:18,526 --> 01:29:19,185
Please

811
01:29:19,560 --> 01:29:21,790
Haku helped me

812
01:29:21,929 --> 01:29:23,453
Now I want to help him

813
01:29:25,132 --> 01:29:28,465
You can get there all right...

814
01:29:28,569 --> 01:29:30,469
But getting back...

815
01:29:30,871 --> 01:29:32,566
Wait here

816
01:29:35,042 --> 01:29:38,239
Let's see now...
It's around here, I think...

817
01:29:39,046 --> 01:29:41,981
Everyone, I need my shoes
and my clothes, please

818
01:29:50,424 --> 01:29:53,393
Sen! I hunted for you
everywhere!

819
01:29:56,063 --> 01:29:57,121
Lin

820
01:29:57,231 --> 01:29:59,893
That's Haku
What happened here...

821
01:30:00,601 --> 01:30:01,499
Who are these guys?

822
01:30:02,737 --> 01:30:04,898
My new friends

823
01:30:05,239 --> 01:30:08,504
Yubaba's tearing the place
apart looking for you

824
01:30:08,609 --> 01:30:12,101
The big tipper turned out to
be a horrible monster, No Face

825
01:30:12,747 --> 01:30:15,341
<i>Yubaba says you led him here</i>

826
01:30:18,619 --> 01:30:19,677
Maybe I did

827
01:30:19,854 --> 01:30:22,015
You serious?!

828
01:30:22,123 --> 01:30:23,920
I just thought
he was a customer...

829
01:30:24,091 --> 01:30:26,924
He's already swallowed
two Frogs and a Slug!

830
01:30:27,461 --> 01:30:30,430
Found it!
Here it is, Sen!

831
01:30:30,931 --> 01:30:32,558
We're busy, gramps

832
01:30:32,667 --> 01:30:34,635
You can use this

833
01:30:35,636 --> 01:30:38,434
That's a train ticket
Where'd you get that?

834
01:30:38,606 --> 01:30:41,040
I've had it for 40 years

835
01:30:41,175 --> 01:30:44,770
Now listen, it's the 6th stop,
called Swamp Bottom

836
01:30:45,146 --> 01:30:46,272
Swamp Bottom?

837
01:30:46,380 --> 01:30:48,280
That's right, it's the 6th stop

838
01:30:48,449 --> 01:30:49,313
The 6th stop

839
01:30:49,617 --> 01:30:53,417
Make sure you get it right
There used to be a return train,

840
01:30:53,521 --> 01:30:55,455
but these days
it's a one-way ride

841
01:30:55,556 --> 01:30:57,046
Still interested?

842
01:30:57,291 --> 01:31:00,658
Yup
I'll walk back, along the tracks

843
01:31:02,229 --> 01:31:03,958
But what about Yubaba?

844
01:31:04,131 --> 01:31:05,621
I'll go to her now

845
01:31:06,167 --> 01:31:09,830
I promise I'll be back, Haku
You can't die

846
01:31:10,638 --> 01:31:12,503
What's going on here?

847
01:31:12,840 --> 01:31:15,172
Don't you see?
It's called... Love...

848
01:31:23,184 --> 01:31:25,584
It just keeps getting bigger!

849
01:31:25,686 --> 01:31:27,278
Don't let it swallow me!

850
01:31:27,388 --> 01:31:28,184
Here she comes!

851
01:31:35,863 --> 01:31:37,296
Thank goodness, Sen!

852
01:31:37,431 --> 01:31:39,899
Yubaba can't control him

853
01:31:42,870 --> 01:31:46,636
There's no need to get upset
I'm sure Sen will turn up

854
01:31:47,108 --> 01:31:49,542
Where's Sen! I want Sen!

855
01:31:49,910 --> 01:31:51,537
Go, hurry

856
01:31:56,917 --> 01:31:58,851
Yubaba, it's Sen

857
01:31:58,953 --> 01:32:00,443
Where were you!

858
01:32:00,554 --> 01:32:04,888
Sen has come, dear guest
We'll be right with you

859
01:32:05,926 --> 01:32:09,020
What took you so long!
This is a complete disaster!

860
01:32:09,130 --> 01:32:11,894
Suck up to him and squeeze
all his gold out of him

861
01:32:15,936 --> 01:32:18,234
What's that filthy rat?!

862
01:32:20,107 --> 01:32:22,405
Don't you recognize him?

863
01:32:22,743 --> 01:32:25,439
Of course not,
how disgusting!

864
01:32:25,679 --> 01:32:26,976
Now, in you go

865
01:32:28,582 --> 01:32:30,777
Call if you need us

866
01:32:31,752 --> 01:32:34,152
Is she all right
in there by herself?

867
01:32:34,255 --> 01:32:36,086
Want to take her place?

868
01:32:56,610 --> 01:32:59,704
Try this, it's yummy

869
01:33:01,649 --> 01:33:06,052
Want some gold?
I'm not giving it to anybody else

870
01:33:10,157 --> 01:33:11,920
Come over here, Sen

871
01:33:12,026 --> 01:33:15,553
What is it you want?
You can tell me

872
01:33:15,996 --> 01:33:17,930
Where did you come from?

873
01:33:18,032 --> 01:33:20,296
There's someplace
I have to go right away

874
01:33:22,803 --> 01:33:25,271
You should go back
where you came from

875
01:33:25,372 --> 01:33:28,307
You can't help me
with what I want

876
01:33:30,311 --> 01:33:33,178
Where's your home?
Don't you have a mom and dad?

877
01:33:34,148 --> 01:33:37,311
I don't wanna...
Don't wanna...

878
01:33:38,385 --> 01:33:42,151
I'm lonely, lonely...

879
01:33:42,990 --> 01:33:44,355
Can't you get back home?

880
01:33:44,859 --> 01:33:48,351
I want Sen, want Sen

881
01:33:49,029 --> 01:33:50,018
Take the gold

882
01:33:50,698 --> 01:33:51,824
Are you going to eat me?

883
01:33:51,999 --> 01:33:52,795
Take it!

884
01:33:52,900 --> 01:33:53,696
Take it!

885
01:34:03,043 --> 01:34:05,671
If you're going to eat me,
have this first

886
01:34:06,380 --> 01:34:10,339
I was saving it for my parents,
but you can have it

887
01:34:31,238 --> 01:34:32,535
Sen!

888
01:34:35,075 --> 01:34:39,307
Girl!
What did you feed me?!

889
01:34:54,094 --> 01:34:55,322
Out of my way!

890
01:34:56,597 --> 01:34:58,565
Not on my premises!

891
01:35:11,845 --> 01:35:13,244
Over here

892
01:35:14,081 --> 01:35:15,343
Here!

893
01:36:00,160 --> 01:36:01,787
You'll pay for this!

894
01:36:19,313 --> 01:36:21,247
Sen, over here!

895
01:36:37,698 --> 01:36:39,962
There he is
Over here!

896
01:36:40,067 --> 01:36:41,659
Don't call him over

897
01:36:45,539 --> 01:36:49,168
He's only bad in the bath house
He needs to get out of there

898
01:36:49,376 --> 01:36:51,503
But take him where?

899
01:36:51,678 --> 01:36:52,645
I don't know...

900
01:36:52,746 --> 01:36:57,183
You don't know...
He's following us

901
01:37:14,768 --> 01:37:15,757
From here, you walk

902
01:37:15,869 --> 01:37:16,858
OK

903
01:37:16,970 --> 01:37:18,699
You'll find the station

904
01:37:18,872 --> 01:37:20,237
Thank you

905
01:37:20,908 --> 01:37:22,466
You better come back!

906
01:37:22,743 --> 01:37:23,710
OK

907
01:37:27,915 --> 01:37:31,373
I know I called you a klutz!

908
01:37:31,552 --> 01:37:33,042
I take it back!

909
01:37:41,261 --> 01:37:45,322
No Face, if you so much as
touch that girl, you'll pay for it!

910
01:37:48,735 --> 01:37:49,997
There it is

911
01:38:01,615 --> 01:38:03,947
Train's coming, here we go

912
01:38:27,474 --> 01:38:29,601
I'm riding to Swamp Bottom

913
01:38:36,316 --> 01:38:37,943
You want to come, too?

914
01:38:39,486 --> 01:38:41,454
Him too, please

915
01:39:22,029 --> 01:39:23,326
Come here

916
01:39:23,997 --> 01:39:25,589
Behave yourself, OK?

917
01:41:27,821 --> 01:41:29,220
Kamaji

918
01:41:31,658 --> 01:41:34,252
Oh, Haku...
You're awake

919
01:41:34,361 --> 01:41:35,794
Where's Sen?

920
01:41:36,330 --> 01:41:38,798
What happened, please tell me

921
01:41:39,166 --> 01:41:41,964
Don't you remember anything?

922
01:41:42,636 --> 01:41:44,661
Just little pieces

923
01:41:44,905 --> 01:41:47,965
Chihiro kept calling my name
in the darkness

924
01:41:48,308 --> 01:41:52,176
I followed her voice and
woke up lying here...

925
01:41:52,679 --> 01:41:54,647
Chihiro, huh...

926
01:41:54,815 --> 01:41:57,511
Her real name's Chihiro?

927
01:41:58,819 --> 01:42:01,583
Can't beat the power of love...

928
01:42:05,359 --> 01:42:08,453
This gold hardly
covers the damage

929
01:42:08,562 --> 01:42:11,360
That fool, Sen!
She just cost me a fortune

930
01:42:11,998 --> 01:42:15,661
But, Sen did save us, after all

931
01:42:15,836 --> 01:42:16,962
Silence!

932
01:42:17,070 --> 01:42:19,504
She started it all,

933
01:42:19,606 --> 01:42:21,938
and now she's run away

934
01:42:22,042 --> 01:42:24,602
Even abandoned
her own parents!

935
01:42:25,379 --> 01:42:29,110
They must be fine fat pigs by now
Turn them into bacon or ham

936
01:42:29,549 --> 01:42:31,176
Please wait

937
01:42:32,352 --> 01:42:33,478
Master Haku!

938
01:42:33,587 --> 01:42:35,714
What, you still alive?

939
01:42:38,225 --> 01:42:41,524
You still can't see that
you've lost something precious?

940
01:42:42,062 --> 01:42:44,860
You've gotten pretty fresh

941
01:42:45,031 --> 01:42:47,431
Since when do you talk that way?

942
01:43:39,119 --> 01:43:41,087
Baby...

943
01:43:47,093 --> 01:43:48,720
Baby!

944
01:43:48,829 --> 01:43:49,761
It's just sand!

945
01:43:49,963 --> 01:43:52,761
Baby!

946
01:43:53,266 --> 01:43:56,963
Where are you, baby!

947
01:43:57,437 --> 01:44:00,031
Come out, please!

948
01:44:00,774 --> 01:44:02,002
Baby!

949
01:44:05,312 --> 01:44:07,610
Baby, baby!

950
01:44:12,285 --> 01:44:16,654
You!

951
01:44:17,991 --> 01:44:21,290
Tell me!

952
01:44:22,829 --> 01:44:26,959
Where did you hide my baby?!

953
01:44:27,467 --> 01:44:29,264
He's with Zeniba

954
01:44:29,369 --> 01:44:31,337
Zeniba?

955
01:44:52,359 --> 01:44:56,090
I get it, that evil witch

956
01:44:56,229 --> 01:44:58,857
So she thinks she's beaten me

957
01:45:00,534 --> 01:45:02,661
So, what's your plan?

958
01:45:03,169 --> 01:45:05,330
I'll bring baby back

959
01:45:05,505 --> 01:45:09,669
But in exchange, return Sen and
her parents to the human world

960
01:45:10,010 --> 01:45:12,171
And what becomes of you?!

961
01:45:12,546 --> 01:45:16,175
Let's say I tear you to pieces
after sending them back!

962
01:46:03,096 --> 01:46:05,087
I think this is the right stop...

963
01:46:06,066 --> 01:46:07,328
Let's go

964
01:46:34,160 --> 01:46:35,991
You can ride on my shoulder

965
01:47:54,541 --> 01:47:56,236
Come in

966
01:48:01,081 --> 01:48:02,878
Excuse us

967
01:48:04,884 --> 01:48:07,250
Well, hurry up and come in, then

968
01:48:07,754 --> 01:48:09,051
C'mon

969
01:48:12,392 --> 01:48:14,189
So you all made it

970
01:48:14,294 --> 01:48:14,885
Um...

971
01:48:14,994 --> 01:48:16,723
Have a seat

972
01:48:16,896 --> 01:48:19,262
I'll make you some tea

973
01:48:24,938 --> 01:48:29,068
Zeniba, Haku stole this from you
I brought it back

974
01:48:32,445 --> 01:48:34,777
Do you know what this is?

975
01:48:35,248 --> 01:48:38,217
No, but I know it's very precious

976
01:48:38,318 --> 01:48:41,913
I'm here to apologize for Haku
I'm sorry

977
01:48:42,856 --> 01:48:45,882
You felt fine while you held it?

978
01:48:45,992 --> 01:48:46,924
What?

979
01:48:47,026 --> 01:48:49,620
What's this?
The spell is gone

980
01:48:50,930 --> 01:48:54,058
I'm sorry
I stepped on that strange bug

981
01:48:54,167 --> 01:48:55,930
that was on the seal
and squashed it

982
01:48:56,536 --> 01:48:58,663
Squashed it!

983
01:49:00,774 --> 01:49:04,073
You know, my sister snuck
that bug into the dragon,

984
01:49:04,177 --> 01:49:06,975
so she could control
her apprentice

985
01:49:07,113 --> 01:49:09,604
Squashed it!

986
01:49:12,452 --> 01:49:14,181
You sit too

987
01:49:14,287 --> 01:49:16,983
You're No Face, aren't you?
You sit, too

988
01:49:18,057 --> 01:49:21,754
Oh, um, please turn
them back into themselves

989
01:49:21,861 --> 01:49:24,955
Why my dears,
the spell's long broken

990
01:49:25,064 --> 01:49:27,464
You can turn yourselves back

991
01:49:34,808 --> 01:49:38,608
My sister and I are two halves of
a whole, but we really don't get along

992
01:49:38,711 --> 01:49:41,305
You've seen what
bad taste she has

993
01:49:41,414 --> 01:49:44,474
Sorceress twins are
just a recipe for trouble

994
01:49:48,521 --> 01:49:52,981
I'd like to help you, dear
but there's nothing I can do

995
01:49:53,159 --> 01:49:55,024
It's one of our rules here

996
01:49:55,662 --> 01:49:58,631
You've got to take care of your
parents and that dragon boyfriend

997
01:49:58,731 --> 01:50:00,392
of yours, on your own

998
01:50:00,500 --> 01:50:03,333
But, um, can't you
even give me a hint?

999
01:50:03,837 --> 01:50:07,398
I feel like Haku and I met,
a long time ago

1000
01:50:07,507 --> 01:50:09,338
In that case, it's easy

1001
01:50:09,709 --> 01:50:12,337
Nothing that happens,
is ever forgotten,

1002
01:50:12,512 --> 01:50:14,605
even if you
can't remember it

1003
01:50:16,015 --> 01:50:19,280
It's already late
Why don't you stay the night?

1004
01:50:19,719 --> 01:50:22,517
You boys give me a hand

1005
01:50:28,695 --> 01:50:30,629
Keep at it

1006
01:50:33,700 --> 01:50:37,864
That's right, you're terrific
You're a big help...

1007
01:50:38,738 --> 01:50:41,969
A magic one
won't do the trick

1008
01:50:43,376 --> 01:50:47,642
Pull it through there...
And do it again

1009
01:50:47,881 --> 01:50:50,543
I really have to
go home, granny

1010
01:50:51,150 --> 01:50:54,608
Haku could die while
I'm just sitting here...

1011
01:50:54,821 --> 01:50:58,313
They might eat my mom and dad!

1012
01:51:00,560 --> 01:51:03,290
Just wait a little longer

1013
01:51:03,396 --> 01:51:04,886
There we are

1014
01:51:05,765 --> 01:51:07,995
Use it tie back your hair

1015
01:51:12,171 --> 01:51:13,729
It's so pretty

1016
01:51:14,073 --> 01:51:18,840
It'll protect you
I made it from the thread they spun

1017
01:51:19,245 --> 01:51:20,769
Thank you

1018
01:51:30,089 --> 01:51:33,923
What good timing
We've got another guest, let him in

1019
01:51:34,027 --> 01:51:35,085
Sure

1020
01:51:48,441 --> 01:51:49,430
Haku!

1021
01:51:50,777 --> 01:51:52,267
Haku!

1022
01:51:52,779 --> 01:51:54,303
Thank goodness

1023
01:51:54,647 --> 01:51:57,115
Aren't you hurt?
You sure you're OK?

1024
01:51:57,450 --> 01:51:58,280
Thank goodness

1025
01:52:00,286 --> 01:52:02,481
Good timing, I'd say

1026
01:52:03,156 --> 01:52:05,624
Look, granny, Haku's alive

1027
01:52:06,159 --> 01:52:10,289
Haku, I no longer blame
you for what you did

1028
01:52:10,463 --> 01:52:13,660
Just be sure you protect the girl

1029
01:52:14,167 --> 01:52:17,102
OK, boys, time you went home

1030
01:52:17,203 --> 01:52:19,296
Come again soon

1031
01:52:20,006 --> 01:52:24,340
You, stick around
and be my helper

1032
01:52:26,846 --> 01:52:27,676
Granny!

1033
01:52:28,481 --> 01:52:30,608
Thank you, I'm going now

1034
01:52:30,717 --> 01:52:33,811
I'm sure you can
manage everything

1035
01:52:33,920 --> 01:52:37,151
My real name is Chihiro

1036
01:52:37,323 --> 01:52:39,791
Chihiro... what a nice name

1037
01:52:39,892 --> 01:52:41,883
Take good care of it,
it's yours

1038
01:52:41,995 --> 01:52:42,586
I will!

1039
01:52:42,695 --> 01:52:44,492
Off you go

1040
01:52:46,199 --> 01:52:49,259
Thank you, granny
Good bye

1041
01:53:38,418 --> 01:53:40,045
Listen, Haku

1042
01:53:40,219 --> 01:53:43,711
I don't remember it, but
my mom told me...

1043
01:53:44,157 --> 01:53:47,718
Once, when I was little,
I fell into a river

1044
01:53:48,261 --> 01:53:51,890
She said they'd drained it
and built things on top

1045
01:53:52,265 --> 01:53:54,392
But I've just remembered

1046
01:53:55,568 --> 01:53:57,160
The river was called...

1047
01:53:57,603 --> 01:54:00,731
Its name was the Kohaku River

1048
01:54:01,407 --> 01:54:04,570
Your real name is Kohaku

1049
01:54:25,965 --> 01:54:27,432
Chihiro, thank you

1050
01:54:27,600 --> 01:54:30,763
My real name is
Nigihayami Kohaku Nushi

1051
01:54:31,304 --> 01:54:32,271
Nigihayami?

1052
01:54:32,438 --> 01:54:34,668
Nigihayami Kohaku Nushi

1053
01:54:34,774 --> 01:54:37,208
What a name
Sounds like a god

1054
01:54:37,643 --> 01:54:42,080
I remember too, how
you fell into me as a child

1055
01:54:42,181 --> 01:54:43,773
You had dropped your shoe

1056
01:54:44,317 --> 01:54:48,447
Yes, you carried me
to shallow water, Kohaku

1057
01:54:49,322 --> 01:54:50,448
I'm so grateful...

1058
01:55:23,356 --> 01:55:24,755
They're back!

1059
01:55:38,037 --> 01:55:41,006
You brought Baby back
with you, right?

1060
01:55:43,676 --> 01:55:44,574
Baba!

1061
01:55:44,677 --> 01:55:49,080
You're not hurt?
What a terrible time you had

1062
01:55:50,349 --> 01:55:53,341
Baby, you're standing all by yourself?
When?

1063
01:55:54,053 --> 01:55:56,180
Yubaba, you promised

1064
01:55:56,355 --> 01:55:59,119
Please return Chihiro's family
to the human world

1065
01:55:59,725 --> 01:56:02,193
Not so fast

1066
01:56:02,361 --> 01:56:05,296
This world has rules, you know!

1067
01:56:06,065 --> 01:56:07,225
Shut up!

1068
01:56:07,366 --> 01:56:09,857
Baba, what a miser
Just can it

1069
01:56:10,236 --> 01:56:12,727
Baby had such a good time

1070
01:56:13,239 --> 01:56:16,037
But, a rule's a rule

1071
01:56:16,209 --> 01:56:18,370
Otherwise I can't break the spell

1072
01:56:18,744 --> 01:56:21,736
If you make Sen cry,
I won't like you anymore, Baba

1073
01:56:22,381 --> 01:56:23,507
Why that's...

1074
01:56:23,616 --> 01:56:25,049
Granny

1075
01:56:25,151 --> 01:56:26,243
Granny!?

1076
01:56:26,752 --> 01:56:28,743
I'm coming to you

1077
01:56:40,233 --> 01:56:42,531
Haku told me all about the rule

1078
01:56:42,635 --> 01:56:44,466
Least you've got guts

1079
01:56:44,570 --> 01:56:47,801
Here's your contract
Come over here

1080
01:56:47,940 --> 01:56:50,340
I won't be a minute, Baby

1081
01:56:51,110 --> 01:56:52,407
Don't worry

1082
01:56:56,916 --> 01:57:00,682
See if you can guess
which of them are yours

1083
01:57:10,096 --> 01:57:11,563
You only get one guess

1084
01:57:11,664 --> 01:57:14,132
Get it right, and you're all free

1085
01:57:26,145 --> 01:57:29,637
Granny, this is no good
My parents aren't here

1086
01:57:30,116 --> 01:57:33,449
Not here?!
That's your answer?

1087
01:57:35,121 --> 01:57:35,985
Yes

1088
01:57:38,958 --> 01:57:42,121
Bingo!

1089
01:57:42,295 --> 01:57:44,729
Thatta girl!
Right on!

1090
01:57:48,668 --> 01:57:49,965
Thank you, everyone

1091
01:57:50,136 --> 01:57:53,333
Go! You win
Just get out of here!

1092
01:57:53,839 --> 01:57:55,739
Thank you for everything

1093
01:57:56,475 --> 01:57:57,737
Good bye

1094
01:57:58,511 --> 01:57:59,603
Thank you

1095
01:57:59,712 --> 01:58:00,679
Come and see us

1096
01:58:01,147 --> 01:58:01,704
Haku

1097
01:58:01,814 --> 01:58:02,746
Let's go

1098
01:58:03,516 --> 01:58:04,778
Where are Mom and Dad?

1099
01:58:04,884 --> 01:58:06,010
They've gone on ahead

1100
01:58:13,693 --> 01:58:14,990
There's no water!

1101
01:58:15,161 --> 01:58:16,594
I can't go any farther

1102
01:58:17,163 --> 01:58:19,495
Go back the way
you came, Chihiro

1103
01:58:19,598 --> 01:58:22,590
But don't ever look back
Not until you're out of the tunnel

1104
01:58:22,868 --> 01:58:24,836
What about you, Haku?

1105
01:58:25,371 --> 01:58:28,169
I'll speak to Yubaba
Quit my apprenticeship

1106
01:58:28,341 --> 01:58:30,707
I'm fine, now that I have
my name back

1107
01:58:31,377 --> 01:58:33,174
I'll go back to my world, too

1108
01:58:33,346 --> 01:58:34,745
Can we meet again?

1109
01:58:34,847 --> 01:58:35,677
I'm sure

1110
01:58:35,781 --> 01:58:36,338
Promise

1111
01:58:36,515 --> 01:58:37,379
Promise

1112
01:58:37,516 --> 01:58:40,007
Now go, and don't look back

1113
01:59:02,742 --> 01:59:04,209
Chihiro!

1114
01:59:04,710 --> 01:59:07,201
Where have you been?
Hurry up

1115
01:59:10,883 --> 01:59:12,680
Mom! Dad!

1116
01:59:12,785 --> 01:59:14,548
You can't just run off like that

1117
01:59:14,653 --> 01:59:15,950
Away we go

1118
01:59:16,422 --> 01:59:18,549
Mom, are you sure you're OK?

1119
01:59:18,724 --> 01:59:22,922
What? I'm sure the moving
van's there by now

1120
01:59:32,338 --> 01:59:34,568
Hurry along, Chihiro

1121
01:59:43,282 --> 01:59:45,045
Watch your step

1122
01:59:45,151 --> 01:59:48,416
You'll make me trip, Chihiro
clinging like that

1123
02:00:00,699 --> 02:00:02,166
The end of the tunnel

1124
02:00:02,601 --> 02:00:03,795
Hey...

1125
02:00:04,136 --> 02:00:05,433
What is it?

1126
02:00:06,305 --> 02:00:08,205
Will you look at that

1127
02:00:09,308 --> 02:00:11,776
It's all dusty inside, too

1128
02:00:11,944 --> 02:00:12,740
Some kind of joke?

1129
02:00:12,845 --> 02:00:13,937
You think?

1130
02:00:14,046 --> 02:00:16,514
I told you not to stop here

1131
02:00:22,121 --> 02:00:24,555
OK, all clear

1132
02:00:25,825 --> 02:00:28,089
We're off, Chihiro

1133
02:00:28,194 --> 02:00:30,958
Hurry up, Chihiro!

1134
02:00:58,170 --> 02:01:03,767
<i>Somewhere, a voice calls,
in the depths of my heart</i>

1135
02:01:03,976 --> 02:01:09,608
<i>May I always be dreaming,
the dreams that move my heart</i>

1136
02:01:09,782 --> 02:01:15,311
<i>So many tears, of sadness,
uncountable through and through</i>

1137
02:01:15,587 --> 02:01:21,526
<i>I know on the other side of them,
I'll find you</i>

1138
02:01:22,261 --> 02:01:27,995
<i>Everytime we fall down to the ground,
we look up to the blue sky above</i>

1139
02:01:28,100 --> 02:01:33,003
<i>We wake to its blueness, as for
the first time</i>

1140
02:01:33,105 --> 02:01:38,771
<i>Though the road is long and lonely and
the end far away, out of sight</i>

1141
02:01:38,877 --> 02:01:44,474
<i>I can with these two arms,
embrace the light</i>

1142
02:01:46,618 --> 02:01:52,352
<i>As I bid farewell, my heart stops,
in tenderness I feel</i>

1143
02:01:52,524 --> 02:01:58,121
<i>My silent empty body begins to listen to
what is real</i>

1144
02:01:58,297 --> 02:02:04,099
<i>The wonder of living,
the wonder of dying</i>

1145
02:02:04,203 --> 02:02:10,369
<i>The wind, town and flowers,
we all dance one unity</i>

1146
02:02:36,335 --> 02:02:41,830
<i>Somewhere, a voice calls,
in the depths of my heart</i>

1147
02:02:41,940 --> 02:02:47,503
<i>Keep dreaming your dreams,
don't ever let them part</i>

1148
02:02:47,679 --> 02:02:53,117
<i>Why speak of all your sadness or
of life's painful woes</i>

1149
02:02:53,218 --> 02:02:59,088
<i>Instead let the same lips sing
a gentle song for you</i>

1150
02:02:59,892 --> 02:03:05,524
<i>The whispering voice, we never want
to forget, in each passing memory</i>

1151
02:03:05,697 --> 02:03:10,430

<i>When a mirror has been broken,
shattered pieces scattered on the ground</i>

1153
02:03:16,375 --> 02:03:21,813
<i>Glimpses of new life,
reflected all around</i>

<i>Window of beginning, stillness,
new light of the dawn</i>

<i>Let my silent empty body be filled
and reborn</i>

<i>No need to search outside,
nor sail across the sea</i>

it's right here inside me</i>

02:03:46,505 --> 02:03:53,775
<i>I've found a brightness,
it's always with me</i>
